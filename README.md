##  Overview

<code>WorkwiseAI is an AI Agent framework that pinpoints business workflow inefficiencies and streamlines processes using cutting-edge IBM Granite models.</code>

### Some key use cases of IBM Cloud Services in enhancing business workflows
1. Vodafone, a global communications leader, is using IBM Watson to simulate and analyze digital disucssions with its AI powered virtual agent, reducing testing timelines to under 1 minute. [Read more](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/vodafone-tobi)
2. Artefact, a leading French Bank uses a portfolio of personas represented by AI identities, allowing professionals to reveal crucial insights from customer behavior.

## Features

- **Business workflow context grounding** using a knowledge base of company documents, in <code>IBM Vector Indexes</code>.

- **Cutting-edge AI Insights** in generative tasks through the state-of-the-art <code>granite-3-8b-instruct</code> foundation model. [See Model card](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.1-8b-instruct)

- **Workflow visualization dashboard** in Streamlit with clear, interactive widgets to represent large data.

- **WorkwiseAI 'S3' Agent** - a ground-up agent pipeline built on top of the LangChain Framework in IBM AgentLab to analyze business workflow inefficiencies. This enables powerful support for 3 worker agents defined as follows.

  - **Summarizer agent**: Breaks down business workflow steps from the context of the knowledge base to reveal critical insights and inefficiency factors.
  - **Scorer agent**: Evaluates each step in the current workflow using a custom scoring model alongside industry-relevant metrics.
  - **Suggester agent**: Access to tools like WikipediaQuery, GoDuckGoSearch, and RAGQuery to suggest actionable improvements to each step in the workflow.
